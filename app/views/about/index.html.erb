Welcome to Jungle, your number one source for all things you could ever need if you were lost in a jungle. We're dedicated to giving you the very best products, with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness.
<br>
<br>
Founded in 2001 by George, Jungle has come a long way from its beginnings in a jungle. When George first started out, his passion for swinging vines, and helping others drove him to do intense research on the jungleweb, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the eco-friendly wing of the buy and sell industry.
<br>
<br>
We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
<br>
George of the Jungle | Founder, CEO, King of the Jungle
